  "model": "sonnet"
}
```

### Advanced Database Operations
```javascript
{

## 🤖 Using as AI Agent Tool

**NEW!** Claude Code can now be used as a **tool** by AI agents in n8n, not just as a regular workflow node.

### What's the Difference?

- **Regular Node**: You add Claude Code to your workflow and control when it executes
- **AI Agent Tool**: AI agents (like LangChain agents) can automatically call Claude Code when they need coding assistance

### Setting Up as a Tool

1. Add the **"Claude Code Tool"** node to your workflow (separate from the regular "Claude Code" node)
2. Configure the tool's name, description, and parameters
3. Connect it to your AI agent (LangChain Agent, etc.)
4. The agent will automatically use Claude Code when it needs to:
   - Analyze or write code
   - Fix bugs
   - Read/write files
   - Execute bash commands
   - And more!

### Example: AI Agent with Claude Code Tool
```
Manual Chat Trigger
  ↓
LangChain Agent
  ↓ (tools)
Claude Code Tool  ←  The agent calls this automatically when needed
```

**User**: "Please analyze my Python project and suggest improvements"

**Agent**: *Automatically calls Claude Code Tool to examine the codebase and provide detailed recommendations*

This makes Claude Code available to any AI agent in your n8n workflows, enabling more autonomous and intelligent automation!

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 🎯 **Use Project Paths**
Always set a project path for better context and results:
```
/home/user/projects/my-app
```

### 🔒 **Configure Permissions**
Control what Claude Code can do in `.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["Read(*)", "Write(*)", "Bash(npm test)"],
    "deny": ["Bash(rm -rf *)"]
  }
}
```

### 🔗 **Chain Operations**
Use "Continue" operation to build complex multi-step workflows while maintaining context.

### 📊 **Output Formats**
- **Structured**: Full details with metrics
- **Messages**: For debugging
- **Text**: Simple results for chaining
